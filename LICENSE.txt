Special Clause on GUI Usage

Use of Thermobar in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), including but not limited to applications that provide point-and-click access to Thermobar’s functions, requires prior written permission from the author.

This requirement exists because of a broader issue in the geoscience community: tools that wrap or interface with core scientific software often receive the bulk of citations, while foundational packages like Thermobar go unrecognized—particularly when journals impose citation limits. Thermobar represents a significant and ongoing labor investment. Responsible citation and acknowledgment are necessary to support its continued development and maintenance.
