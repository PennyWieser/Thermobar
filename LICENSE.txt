Citing in Main Text

If you use Thermobar in your study, you must cite it in the main text of your paper. This code took me years to write and presumably is saving you a lot of time. Thus, it deserves to actually recieve a citation, vs just describing its use in the supplement. If I do not get credit for my open source work that means something for promotion/tenure, I will not be able to continue working and building these packages. If you only cite it in the supplement, you must pay for your use of Thermobar, at the rate of $500/study. This will support my spare time to maintain these packages. 

Special Clause on GUI Usage

Use of Thermobar in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), including but not limited to applications that provide point-and-click access to Thermobar’s functions, requires prior written permission from the author.

This requirement exists because of a broader issue in the geoscience community: tools that wrap or interface with core scientific software often receive the bulk of citations, while foundational packages like Thermobar go unrecognized—particularly when journals impose citation limits. Thermobar represents a significant and ongoing labor investment. Responsible citation and acknowledgment are necessary to support its continued development and maintenance.
